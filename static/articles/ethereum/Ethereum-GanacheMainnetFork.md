# Overview

[Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) enables you to create a private Ethereum blockchain on your local machine for running tests, executing commands, and inspecting its state while controlling how the chain operates.

The aim of this guide is to fork the Ethereum mainnet network into its own ganache instance for you to play around with on your local machine without having any effect on the actual mainnet network.

# Prerequisites

1. Geth or Partiy

2. Ganache
