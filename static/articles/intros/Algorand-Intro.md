Algorand is a scalable, secure, and decentralized digital currency and smart contract platform. Its protocol uses a variation of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) called Pure PoS (PPoS) to secure the network and reach consensus on block production. Unlike other PoS models, PPoS does not reward, nor does it put validator or user funds at risk of being slashed (a loss of funds used to promote honest node and user behavior). Algorand intends to eventually leverage its PPoS design to form the foundation for an on-chain governance system.

Founded by Turing award winner and MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand is a permissionless pure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol. Unlike first-generation consensus mechanisms, Algorand's technology finalizes blocks in seconds and aims to provide immediate transaction finality while preventing forks. Algorand does also not reward validators with newly minted tokens. 

With a focus on developers and their needs, Algorand's node repository has been open sourced and is publicly available. Algorand provides a robust set of developer tools, dApp analytics through a partnership with Flipside Crypto, and has a number of partners building on its blockchain, including OTOY, Syncsort, TOP Networks, Asset Block and more.
