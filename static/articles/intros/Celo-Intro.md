Celo is a smart contract platform powered by digital assets that tokenize gold and fiat currencies as stablecoins.

Celo is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain based on Ethereum designed to support stablecoins and tokenized assets with an algorithmic reserve-backed stability mechanism. The protocol initially creates two tokens: a reserve token, Celo Gold, with a fixed supply that is divided between the protocol's asset reserve and a diversified basket of other digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin and Ether), and elastic fiat-pegged coins (e.g., Celo Dollar or Celo Euro), a means-of-payment asset that adjusts its supply according to use to maintain a fiat peg.
