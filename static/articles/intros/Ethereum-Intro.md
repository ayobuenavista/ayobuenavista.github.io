Ethereum (ETH), conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, is a smart contract platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps). It is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.
