Flow is the blockchain for open worlds. It is described as a fast and developer-friendly blockchain built to support entire ecosystems of apps, games, and the digital assets that power them.

Flow has a pipelined architecture that separates the jobs typically done by a single node across five different node types, significantly reducing redundant effort and improving efficiency. To support this approach, the Flow team developed a new cryptographic technique called Specialized Proofs of Confidential Knowledge (SPoCKs) to address the Verifierâ€™s Dilemma.
