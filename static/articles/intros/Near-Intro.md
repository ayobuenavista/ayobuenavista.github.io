NEAR Protocol is an open-source smart contract platform built to host high-throughput decentralized applications. It uses an experimental technique called sharding to help scale the network and improve overall user experience. NEAR, of the same name, is the native currency that holders can use to pay the costs associated with deploying applications or submitting transactions. The NEAR token also plays a central in the platform's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where participants can stake tokens on the network to increase its cost of attack.

Similar to Ethereum, the concept of gas is also used. Accounts also pay storage rent which accumulates over time and is charged once the account submits a transaction for processing. Storage rent is charged for data and also as a tax on short account names to discourage name squatting.

**Addresses**: uses readable account IDs instead of a hash of a public key. Account IDs contain a minimum length of 2 with maximum length of 64. Account ID consists of Account ID parts separated by "." and each part consists of lowercase alphanumeric symbols separated by either _ or -.
Example: `app.ayobuenavista`

**Consensus**: Sharded Proof-of-Stake with block constructed with a gadget called Doomslug and a slower finality gadget called Nightshade Finality Gadget.

**NEAR Supply**: No hard cap on the total supply
