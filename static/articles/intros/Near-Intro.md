NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is an open-source smart contract platform built to host high-throughput decentralized applications (dApps). It uses an experimental technique called sharding to help scale (i.e., fast transaction times and low fees) the network and improve overall user experience. NEAR supports a native token of the same name that holders can use to pay the costs associated with deploying applications or submitting transactions. The NEAR token also plays a central in the platform's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where participants can lock (i.e., stake) tokens on the network to increase its cost of attack.
