Polkadot is a multi-chain framework platform designed to offer interoperability and scalability for blockchains built on Polkadot. Its base protocol leverages Parity Technologies’ open-source Substrate, allowing Polkadot-based chains and applications to communicate, transact, and transfer data without relying on intermediary products or services. Polkadot does not provide application functionality but instead aims to serve as a relay-chain, hosting dynamic data structures called parallelized chains, or parachains, that provide Polkadot’s consensus, finality and voting logic.
