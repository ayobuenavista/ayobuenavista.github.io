SKALE Labs is the core team creating the code and raising awareness for the SKALE Network, a middle-ware protocol that aims to allow decentralized applications (dApps) to run on a high-speed consensus layer above smart contract platforms like Ethereum and EOS. The SKALE Network is a decentralized, open-source, peer-to-peer (P2P) network that is powered by the Skale utility token, SKL, which prospective node operators use to participate in network consensus. SKALE Labs is headquartered in San Francisco, California and has an office in Kharkiv, Ukraine.
